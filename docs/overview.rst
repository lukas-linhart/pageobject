What is pageobject
------------------

`Pageobject`_ library implements the so-called *Page Object design pattern*
on steroids. This implementation will be henceforth refered to as ``pageobject``.

What is Page Object design pattern
----------------------------------

In essence, Page Objects model the web application and serve
as an interface to actions that can be performed and data
that can be retrieved from it.

In its simplest, traditional form, a Page Object is just a collection
of functions common to a web page to prevent repeating oneself.

While this is usually where the understanding of the Page Object design
pattern ends for many implementations, it is where it just starts
for ``pageobject``.
